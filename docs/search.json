I would also like to create a visualization that demonstrates potential changes in concentrations of native species in each NP overtime. I may need to find additional data about species sightings in national parks by year."

I was a little bit careless in installation and had a couple extra variables in some of the sets that I didn’t need, and in order to join the rows onto each other, I needed each dataset to have the same variables. I made sure to select the variables I wanted to use so that my observations sets were clean.\nAfter that, I needed to make sure each observations data set had a variable that indicated which park is observed in, so I mutated the data to add a variable with where the observation was made. Once I had that variable, I joined all the datasets together and made one giant observations set."

My hypothesis was that as the number of non-native species goes up, the number of native species observations would go down. This may have been a more effective test on plants, or something similar, however, as birds are highly migratory and may not be classified as native or non-native."

Maybe in recent years, there have been more sightings of various species in the parks with changing climates, but further analysis would be required to determine."
